# Overview

This is a rock paper scissors game made with C#. It uses Winforms for the gui.

The ai is currently rng-based. I may update this in the future.

The program features two prgress bars at the bottom of the screen to keep track of who is winning.

The game ends when either the player or the ai reaches a score of 10.
